The function returns the total number of nodes that were activated during the simulation.\n",

It computes the average number of nodes activated across all simulations, giving a more robust estimate of the spread for a given set of seed nodes.\n",

    "greedy_information_diffusion: This is a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects nodes to maximize the spread of information. In each iteration, the algorithm evaluates all nodes not yet in the seed set and selects the node that, when added, maximizes the estimated spread of information. This process is repeated until k nodes are selected."
