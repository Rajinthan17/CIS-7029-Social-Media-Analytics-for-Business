The process continues until no new nodes are activated. The function returns the total number of nodes influenced by the initial seed set.\n",

For each iteration, the algorithm evaluates each node that is not yet in the seed set, adding the node that results in the greatest increase in spread. This process repeats until k nodes are selected."
