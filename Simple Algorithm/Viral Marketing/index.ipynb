Given an initial set of \"seed\" nodes, the function models how information spreads to neighboring nodes with a specified activation probability (activation_prob). The process continues until no new nodes are activated, and the function returns the total number of activated nodes.\n",

It balances between computational complexity and accuracy but can become computationally intensive, especially for large networks, due to multiple simulations for each candidate node.\n",
